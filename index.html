    <p>
        For quite a while I was planning on building a site, but I was a bit stuck in the planning phase. Thoughts raced in my head - should I stick with an easy CMS like WordPress? Maybe more something a bit more bespoke, like Laravel? Or go for something completely different, Java? What about frontend? React is very hot, I should use that...

    <p>
        Before I realised, I've been researching for weeks. I wasted so much time which I could have instead spent on writing and building. At the end of the day, I want to create my own space online, build some fun tools and share my journey of learning more about tech.

        To start off, I am using Github pages for hosting my very simple personal site. I'm not sure what to use for my back-end. My professional experience is with PHP, but I'd like to move away from that in my free time and I'm split between Java and Javascript. Java seems very hot on the market, but I am far more experienced with Javascript. I'd probably end up using a framework, like Express or Spring, as that seems to be widely recommended. 
        <br>
        I will also need to consider proper hosting. But that will all come later.
